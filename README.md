## Technical definition

At the technical level SGT & SNT are a ERC20-compliant tokens, derived from the [MiniMe Token](https://github.com/Giveth/minime) that allows for token cloning (forking), which will be useful for many future use-cases.

Also built in the token is a vesting schedule for limiting SNT transferability over time. Status Project Founders tokens are vesting.
