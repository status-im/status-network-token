/// @title SNTPlaceholder Contract
/// @author Jordi Baylina
/// @dev The SNTPlaceholder contract will take control over the SNT after the contribution
///  is finalized and before the Status Network is deployed.
///  The contract allows for SNT transfers and transferFrom and implements the
///  logic for transferring control of the token to the network when the offering
///  asks it to do so.
