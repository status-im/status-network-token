/// @title ContributionWallet Contract
/// @author Jordi Baylina
/// @dev This contract will be hold the Ether during the contribution period.
///  The idea of this contract is to avoid recycling Ether during the contribution
///  period. So all the ETH collected will be locked here until the contribution
///  period ends

// @dev Contract to hold sale raised funds during the sale period.
// Prevents attack in which the Aragon Multisig sends raised ether
// to the sale contract to mint tokens to itself, and getting the
// funds back immediately.
